Following this I was able to come off amitriptyline, which was great. It is reassuring to know that should I need any further treatment I have Prof Shaikh!",

Following the surgery, he was encouraging, compassionate and clear  in our interactions, whether face to face or on the phone. His positivity and encouragement helped me recover I believe as fast as possible too as I was keen to do everything I could to help myself recover. \nI consider myself incredibly lucky, my cancer was picked up on routine bowel screening, thanks to a 60th  birthday FIT test from the NHS. I had no symptoms. I was seen very quickly by Prof, following colonoscopy,  when he explained that he would operate using robotic surgery  which I had never heard of. This meant that my  operation, took place internally without the need or risks of open surgery. The apertures for the robot were small and healed quickly  afterwards and I was ready for discharge on day 4. \nI am  grateful for the NHS Bowel Screening Programme, and to Prof Shaikh, robot and team.",

It is of course painful for the first 3-5 days and you need to rest but after 5 days I was able to do more or less everything as normal, of course being careful not to lift heavy things and resting to allow body to recover. It would have been beneficial to have more advice from the doctor on nutrition before the procedure and the first 5 days after, also what to expect. The medical secretary of this doctor was super helpful and provided a lot of this information and helped me to get an additional treatment that was needed following the procedure.",

    "Review Text":"This is a follow-up to my submission earlier this month. I first met Professor Shaikh twelve months ago in November 2023. The consultation was for a matter unrelated to my pending hernia surgery. At that time, he examined my abdomen and found two irregularities; one was the hernia which is about to be corrected and the other was a palpable swelling which he suspected might be an aortic aneurysm. He immediately referred me for a CT scan. A week later, the scan confirmed that the aneurism was large and a real risk to life. \n\nLater that afternoon, I took two unexpected phone calls; one from a surgical colleague of Prof. Shaikh who assured me that he would see me without delay at his next clinic to arrange surgery and the other from Mr Shaikh himself to check the situation. I was pleasantly surprised that he had taken so much care to look after my interests. Without his involvement, I would have continued my days without realising what a serious risk to health was lurking in my abdomen. It is fair to say that Professor Shaikh has probably saved me from an early death, and I am truly grateful for his concern and professional competence",

Prof. Shaikh explained the process including the fact that he uses robotics during the surgery. This allows greater accuracy and is less invasive than traditional surgical methods. I initially declined the surgery as I wanted to influence my own health and be in a better place to undergo surgery and make a good recovery if required later on.\nI had a bowel resection operation in May which went well and I was discharged onto the virtual ward (self monitoring at home) in 24hours. This was preferable to a longer stay in hospital. I continue to make a good recovery and am cancer free.",

He exuded an enthusiastic manner and answered my questions, reassuring me that with my general level of fitness and diet the operation shouldn't prove to be a major issue. I left the consultation with a feeling of complete confidence and that this surgeon would be the one to operate on me.\n\nAfter the operation, Professor Shaikh took the trouble to visit the ward to have a chat about the operation and to assess how I was feeling. Shortly before my discharge, he happened to come over again and said that because my blood-haemoglobin levels were rising, I could be discharged the follow day.\n\nMy advice to other potential clients of Professor Shaikh would be to think through the operation trying to visualise what is going to happen, and the issues arising from it and to frame your questions accordingly. I wrote to his NHS secretary before the operation with a list of questions and these were answered promptly. In addition, have questions ready during post-operative recovery even if they amount to something simple and obvious. With answers you can plan the next few weeks without there being any surprises: knowledge is power.",

    "Review Text":"My operation (robotic surgery) was undertaken by Mr Irshad Shaikh and his team on the afternoon of 10th May 2023. Once in the operating theatre where given anaesthetic, it felt like only a few seconds until I was unconscious. In the evening, I came round in a bed in the ward. Not very with it, but I do remember that I was expecting to feel more pain, but there was little. Being able to administer pain killer as required was straightforward (although once given an extra dose by a physiotherapist by mistake, who pressed the dispenser button in error, but no harm done). Staff were excellent throughout.\n     The intention was to be discharged within 48 h but this ran on into Saturday (mainly as no one at home to help look after me on Friday). On Saturday morning (when definitely feeling well enough & wanting to leave) departure was in the afternoon due to delays completing discharge papers, simply due to the volume of work being dealt with by the doctors\/consultants and nurses at the time. I was picked-up by a friend and driven home on Saturday afternoon. Nearby friends were on hand (a phone call away) Saturday onwards (in case an emergency lift was required to hospital). Sunday morning a friend came round and cooked lunch and dinner, and I was gingerly able to walk about (including up and down stairs). \n     Friends did shopping for me for the first 2 weeks or so, subsequently I quickly became more mobile (out for regular short walks and taken shopping). I was able to drive to my Mum\u2019s house (a distance of 134 miles) at the end of July.\n     Thus overall, my experience was very positive and I felt at ease with Mr Shaikh. I was surprised at how rapidly I became relatively fit again and the speed at which my wounds healed (only a minor problem with one incision that oozed a little; given a 1-week dose of antibiotics by GP and healed up within a few days).",

    "Review Text":"Having been diagnosed with a rectal rumour, I did my research and asked if I could have my surgery performed by Professor Shaikh.  Because of where the tumour was located, I felt he could make the difference between having a permanent, or even temporary, stoma post surgery and keeping a more normal bowel function.  I also felt he offered me the best chance for survival going forwards.  My consultation with him was very detailed, but was also very relaxed and humorous at times, which immediately put me at ease.  He explained my diagnosis and the results, gave me 3 options for treating it, the various risks associated with each and his recommendation, which is what I opted for.  This was a robot assisted, laparoscopic anterior resection where the rectum would be excised, as well as the surrounding lymph nodes, and the remaining ends joined together.  I left that consultation feeling so positive.  He instilled confidence.  I had no doubts.  I was given a wealth of information, by the colorectal nurse, to take away with me, which gave more information about the procedure, support networks, what to expect leading up to surgery, post surgery etc.  The surgery took about 5 hours and I was discharged the next day and went onto a 'virtual ward' for the next 11 days, for post operative care.  This service was amazing and it was so much nicer to be recovering at home.  Within the week I was managing to walk around the block, within 3 weeks I had my first meal out in a restaurant and could eat and drink most things again.  There has been a general feeling of discomfort when gas builds up, and slight discomfort when sitting, due to the healing processes taking place, but these are slowly improving with time.  One feature of this whole process, that was really beneficial, was the availability of the colorectal nurse team to answer any queries or concerns that I had pre and post surgery, as they occurred.  The great news is that I don't need any further treatment as the tumour has been completely removed and, on analysis post surgery, there was no sign of spread into the lymph nodes.  I'm so very grateful to Professor Shaikh and his wonderful team for their great skill, professionalism and for giving me my life back.",

My situation made me very inactive and I lost sleep. Although right from my initial consultation Mr Shaikh put my mind at rest. Very informative. Explained he would attempt key-hole surgery for both hernias (repairing 2 hernias in one operation) but if it was not possible during the procedure he would revert to open surgery and only repair the larger hernia of the two, as open surgery for both would result in too painful recovery. For me, Mr Shaikh made keyhole work perfectly for both hernias. Easy to speak with and great at explaining the process. He said he's not a god but, in my opinion he comes very close. Also has a great sense of humour, which helped in putting me at ease. Explained the surgery risks on paper and also the minimal negative outcomes he'd seen his patients experience during his career and made a clear contrast between the two. Answered all of my questions at my follow-up appointment. Above all, he safely got me back to the stage I was at before my hernias occured which at this particular stage of my life, meant the world to me. My surgery was on 26.05.23 and I managed my recovery without any medication whatsoever and I have had no recurrence and have had minimal pain, which has got progressively better as each day passes. Explained to me it could be 6 months before my occasional twinges return to normal. \nTo anyone worried about the concept of surgery, like I was, Mr Shaikh has your back.",

    "Review Text":"I had an operation to remove part of my bowel following a diagnosis of bowel cancer as a result of regular screening. My consultation with Mr Shaikh was arranged very quickly after the diagnosis and he took time to explain the procedure thoroughly and also to respond to any questions, or queries from myself or my husband.  He has a very approachable manner which helped to calm my anxieties to some extent.  The operation was performed by robotic surgery which meant I had minimal scarring for what was a fairly big operation.  I had three nights in hospital following the operation during which Mr Shaikh, or a member of his team, visited on a daily basis. I had never had a major operation before so didn't know what to expect with regards to the effect on my body. However, after the first 10 days, or so, when I had to take things carefully,  I was surprised how quickly I was able to get back to many of my usual activities like walking and yoga and my recovery has continued to progress well since then.",

In my first consultation he went through the risks and informed me that he intended to attempt the repair using key whole surgery. My appointment for surgery came through quickly and seemed to me to go smoothly on the day. Mr Shaikh informed me later that the key whole surgery had been harder than expected due to a previous operation I had had. My hernia repair was a success and I recovered quickly without pain.",

    "Review Text":"Mr Shaikh performed surgery after I suffered a complication related to my Crohn's Disease of the terminal ileum.\n\nI spent several months in hospital due to a infection abscess caused by a perforation in my bowel. I was extremely unwell and also caught COVID whilst on the ward. Mr Shaikh and I agreed that it was best to wait until I had recovered before surgery was performed. Mr Shaikh took time to ensure I had all the relevant information and understood the pros and cons of having emergency surgery versus coming back at a later date. I was kept informed and involved in the decision making process throughout.\n\nSix weeks ago, Mr Shaikh performed a resection of the terminal ileum. I was very upset at the thought of a stoma and had pleaded for this not to happen. Mr Shaikh advised he would do his best but took time to prepare me for the likelihood that this would happen. However, it was clear that he had really listened to me and understood my wishes and my concerns.\n\nMr Shaikh performed the resection using robotic surgery, and I was thrilled to find that a stoma had been avoided. It is very clear that this was not an easy task. The scarring was very minimal, which was really surprising given the complexity of the surgery performed. \n\nI became poorly a few days after surgery and later discovered that Mr Shaikh had come in on his day off to check on me and to ensure that he was involved in any decisions that may need to be taken around going back into surgery. This demonstrates the level of care shown, going above and beyond to ensure my needs and wishes were met. Luckily further surgery was not needed.\n\nMy recovery time was significantly lower due to the use of robotic surgery and my bowel is recovering well. I'm aware that the surgery was very challenging and am eternally grateful to Mr Shaikh for doing everything he could to ensure the best possible outcome, rather than taking the quickest and easiest route. Throughout the whole process I received first class care from Mr Shaikh and his team and I can't thank him enough for giving me my life back.",

    "Review Text":"I had my consultation with Dr Shaikh in July 2022 regarding horrendous discomfort with internal and external haemorrhoids which I had experienced for a number of years.  In the first instance Dr Shaikh made me feel at ease and talked through in detail, which wasn\u2019t in difficult medical terms, but was simple and easy for me to understand. He gave me a number of options and explained what he felt would be good for me and what would help me lead a normal life again.  He explained it would be my decision as to what procedure to go with and when I chose to have the haemorrhoidectomy  procedure, Dr Shaikh was completely honest with what would happen and also with the recovery, which wasn\u2019t going to be easy.  I am not great in hospitals which I explained to Dr Shaikh and I would be forever grateful for the honesty when he explained that it would be very painful for a good 4-6 weeks whilst I was recovering.\n\nOn the day of the surgery, Dr Shaikh came and saw me and the moment I saw him, I felt at ease as I knew I was in good hands. Following the surgery, he came to see me again to make sure I was ok.  \n\nThe first week I was on a lot of pain meds so didn\u2019t really experience too much pain but by the second week and after a bowel movement, Dr Shaikh was absolutely right in that it would be very painful. But as he explained it to me in detail at the consultation it was not a shock to me, however the pain was real! 4 weeks on and I am over the hurdle of the pain and on my way to living my best life !  \n\nI am so glad Dr Shaikh was my consultant and even more glad that he was completely honest about the surgery and the recovery. Although it was extremely painful and I hope I would never have to have it done again, I would highly recommend this surgery to anyone who has been suffering in silence for years, because I am just so happy that I am not living with the pain and discomfort I had been living with for many years. \n\nAnd if you are lucky enough to have Dr Shaikh as your consultant, you are definitely In good hands \u263a\ufe0f \n\nAs a final note, I would also like to add how fantastic and extremely helpful his PA - Donna was too. If you have any questions or anything you need to know, then make sure you speak to Donna. She is absolutely super and the most friendliest person I have spoken to.",

    "Review Text":"In 2017 I was diagnosed with peri-pancreatic cancer with the discovery (following jaundice) of a small tumour on my bile duct. The diagnosis was in Norwich but Addenbrooke\u2019s in Cambridge was where I was sent for surgery. A Whipple\u2019s procedure was carried out in the Summer of 2017 and was deemed to be successful. The procedure was followed up with a course of chemotherapy in Norwich. \nIn January 2019 I was admitted to The Norwich and Norfolk hospital with severe abdominal pain. A colonic tumour was detected and removed in an emergency operation. After the operation I was left with a stoma. Again the surgery was successful and was followed up with a course of Chemotherapy.\n In the Summer of 2020 investigation of pain in the rectal stump revealed another tumour and I began to be investigated by Mr Shaikh and his team with the purpose of seeing if surgery could be offered. All of us were aware of the extent of the surgery already undergone and Mr Shaikh particularly was aware of my discomfort from a large hernia on the previous operation sites. A multidisciplinary team agreed that an operation should be offered and I had preparatory radio and chemotherapy in the Autumn. The operation was carried out in March 2021 and included three teams: a Urology team, Mr Shaikh\u2019s colorectal team and a perineal reconstructive surgical team. In the event a complete pelvic exenteration was carried out and a urostomy left in place alongside the colostomy. \nMy discussions all along the way with Mr Shaikh and his team of specialists were of inestimable importance in my confidence of their care. I was always fully aware of what was being planned and what the likely outcomes were. The facility of robotic surgery being available and deployable by Mr Shaikh was clearly important in the success of this third major operation given the likely complications which might have arisen. I am very grateful to Mr Shaikh for his expertise and care in his dealing with me. Our interaction continues because even though it is over a year since the last operation I still have a pelvic drain in place. This evidentially is still very much needed and Mr Shaikh is always happy to have informative conversations and consultations about next steps. I would also like to add that the team of colorectal nurse specialists who work with Mr Shaikh have provided wonderful advice and care. I appear to be cancer free at the moment.\nI am not unaware of the expense of the treatment I have received particularly in the use of robotic techniques. I am however extremely grateful that they have been available and used in my case. Less precise surgical techniques may well have not been successful or indeed deployable.

    "Review Text":"I had been suffering with severe anal pain for many months and getting nowhere fast with various prescribed ointments. Mr Shaikh quickly diagnosed an anal fissure and soon thereafter performed a lateral internal sphincterotomy.\nI would recommend the procedure to anyone dealing with this condition as the fissure pain disappeared instantly. I was sore for a week or so after but I was able to return to office based work after 5 days and light exercise after a few of weeks. Six weeks on Mr Shaikh has confirmed the fissure has completely healed and I am so pleased.",

    "Review Text":"In relation to other conditions experienced by patients in this review mine was somewhat minor.  Although it brought annoying levels of discomfort when sitting, and prevented me from enjoying my favourite past time of cycling.\nMy GP had diagnosed a pilonidal sinus in April 2018, saying that there was little that could be done medically except a surgical intervention if the condition deteriorated.\nBy November 2018 my tolerance level had reached zero, I asked my GP to arrange a consultation at the Spire Hospital with a view to a surgical intervention.\nAs a result I had a consultation with Mr Shaikh, who I found to be a good listener in the extreme; he displayed a high level of empathy and explained in easily understood terms the options open to me. He stressed that the surgical route although available was not without risks associated with the anal part of the body. He suggested that I wait and watch whilst maintaining an extreme level of hygiene and hopefully the condition would clear up. However, if the problem persisted I was contact him again in March to re-visit the probability of a surgical procedure.\n By following Mr Shaikh\u2019s advice rigorously for several weeks the condition improved and eventually healed completely. A surgical solution was not required.\nAlthough in the realm of private health care, there was never any pressure to take the more expensive surgical option.\nWithout any hesitation I would say that Mr Shaikh is a solid, approachable and caring individual who places the wellbeing of his patients first.",

From my first consultation with him he demonstrated great empathy for my situation, without patronising me.  He fully explained the very complex procedure along with all the \u2018pros\u2019 and \u2018cons\u2019.  He described realistic expectations in an honest, but gentle manner.\nHe showed respect for me as a patient and answered all questions fully, without making me feel that I was asking silly questions.  He kept me fully informed of the treatment I could expect, even phoning me a couple of days before my planned op date to update me on information he had received from colleagues.\nMy operation was totally successful I am delighted to say.  \nWhilst on the ward, Mr Shaikh and the surgical team continued to treat me with respect, informing me of my condition and outcomes in an honest, professional but friendly manner.   The whole experience was totally patient centred.\nAt a follow up appointment some weeks after discharge Mr Shaikh was encouraging and motivational about my good recovery, which, no doubt, aided my recovery further.\nI extend this positive review and sincere thanks to the whole of the colorectal surgical team and nurses that supported me on Dilham ward and HDU during my stay at NNUH.",

    "Review Text":"I had been suffering with a painful backside for about 6 weeks with a gradual increase in severity. I used my local GP service who advised I had an anal fissure. The treatment recommended was very much 'use this cream' and come back if things don't get better. The pain control offered (Naproxen) had absolutely no impact on what I was being hit with. This type of intervention carried on until I was reduced to incapacity to work (self employed), a total panic as to what level of pain I would be suffering from each day and complete despair. I had been admitted to A+E twice where no intervention was offered.\n\nAt this point I contacted Dr Shaikh on advice of the Spire Hospital and attended a consultation. When I arrived at the hospital I was desperate, and extremely alarmed by my terrible pain that would last for hours and absolutely nobody was offering any plan to help. Mr Shaikh changed all that! He listened very carefully to me and agreed with the fissure diagnosis BUT also explained my symptoms were not typical for a fissure, how right he was. Mr Shaikh had such great empathy with my predicament, here was somebody saying that they understood how much pain I was in and it was going to stop. It was the best I had felt in weeks  He was excellent at explaining my anatomy and how that was relevant to my problem. Ultimately he offered a number of treatment options (and described the limitations of each) that he would be able to perform. Unfortunately things progressed to a crescendo of trouble even before Mr Shaikh could operate and the emergency unit of the local hospital were superb. Mr Shaikh was of course correct, a fissure was a small part of the problem with fistulas and abscesses all present  as well. Sadly my local G.Ps had not considered  these possible additional joys in the diagnostic process \nIn summary, Mr Shaikh is one of the most compassionate, professional and diligent people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. His experience and good humour lifted my spirit at a very dark time and I would entirely recommend him to anyone requiring the very best care",

I had spent 6 months with the NHS going through all sorts of tests and having a consultant who wasn't listening to my concerns nor caring about what had happened. \n\nMr Shaikh was very reassuring and put me at ease as soon as I sat down with him, he listened fully to everything I said and discussed everything in detail with me. It took one ultrasound and a look at my previous MRI scan for him and a radiologist to come to a diagnosis within 2 weeks. \n\nI cannot thank him enough for the help and reassurance he provided me, along with the diagnosis that put my mind at ease. Judging by his previous reviews I can see I'm not the only one happy with his work. I would highly recommend.",

    "Review Text":"Mr Shaikh performed a lateral anal sphyncterectomy on me due to an anal fissure. I had suffered in extreme pain for just under a year and tried every cream and ointment available from the doctors. I was getting to the stage where it was not only excruciatingly painful going to the toilet but for hours after I would endure throbbing and burning sensations that would bring me to tears.\nMr Shaikh explained the two options of either having botox injected or the sphyncterectomy. I understood that with the latter there is a chance of incontinence after the operation but that the success rate was much much higher than the botox.\nAfter having the operation I felt immediate relief from the pain. The first time I went to the toilet it was only slightly uncomfortable but no pain afterwards. I took some Cosmocol three times a day for a couple of weeks to make sure I didn\u2019t get constipated as well. \nI can honestly say having the operation was the best choice I made and I have now healed really well and no longer worry about leaving the house or spending hours lying on my bed in pain.\nOther than the immediate healing and small amounts of blood, I have had absolutely no problem with incontinence and still have really good control over my muscles and when I go to the toilet.\nI cannot recommend this surgery enough and should I ever find myself with a fissure again in the future I will not hesitate to get it done again.\nMr Shaikh was extremely efficient, knowledgeable and experienced and i felt confident that he knew exactly what he was doing.\nIn addition, his secretary Donna, was one of the most professional and helpful people I have ever dealt with and made the whole experience much easier for me.",

I was let down by a system without any spare resource. The nurses, doctors and health care assistants (the unsung heroes of our NHS) were overwhelmed.\nDuring 4 days of chaotic care it became evident to me that the only source of continuity is the Consultant who chooses to go beyond the call of duty. In my day they had us as a team - House Officer, SHO, Registrar and Senior Registrar directly accountable. 4 of us to one of them.  Nowadays they share a rotating shift of juniors without a direct line of responsibility. 3 juniors shared between 3 consultants!!  A recipe for disaster. BUT.....Irshad Shaikh and Sandeep Kapur go beyond the call of duty.  They are not superhuman but you're as safe with them as you can be! Relax",

    "Review Text":"After suffering with piles for the past few years, it got to the point where the nagging and excruciating pain had become constant and unbearable, (not good when I'm a keen Road cyclist and Mountain Biker!!), so from the onset of 2017 I was going to get this sorted, once and for all, albeit having to overcome the embarrassment, with some apprehension.\nEarly in the year I was referred to Mr Shaikh, where from the onset he instantly made me feel such at ease, with his professionalism, very approachable personality, and his empathetic approach to my very personal and would-be embarrassing problem. It certainly helped that he has a good sense of humour too!\nHe explained everything very clearly and made sure I knew what all the options were that were open to me, and what all the pro's, con's and success rates were for each of the options. \nUnfortunately for me I had to go through all of the options along the path to (hopefully) finally getting sorted, from initially starting off with the \"banding\" process, through to having 2 bouts of surgery, under General Anaesthetic. At each and every step of the way, Mr Shaikh was absolutely brilliant, such care and dedication in making sure I was ok, explaining everything thoroughly, and what to expect during the recovery process. \nI saw Mr Shaikh, last Tuesday (10th October), where he was pleased with my recovery, to such an extent that he has signed me back over to my own GP.\nI am still in the \"Healing\" stage at present, but what a transformation from where I initially started out from. I cannot speak more highly of, nor recommend Mr Shaikh more, for this transformation. I am hugely thankful to Mr Shaikh, as this has also brought me a much better state of well-being too! Looking forwards to \"pain-free\" cycling from now on!!",

Day one was pretty uncomfortable, being checked every hour for blood pressure, temperature, pulse, etc.  Day two showered alone after quite a Good night, not too mobile but managed to walk to the bathroom, and managed it alone, scar quite uncomfortable but not too bad, day three sent home. First week very limited in doing anything for myself, went to GP and nurse removed clips from wound on tenth day, hadn't healed completely so had to visit GP every other day for redressing, week two much improved but still quite limited and having wound dressed. Dressings down to every other day. Week three improving every day, eventually told no dressings needed. Great news. Week four, feeling much more like my older self, still have to be careful on lifting, stretching etc but much more mobile. Must just remember not to do too much.
